# AutoDeploy Development Session Summary

## Date: July 22, 2025

### Major Features Implemented

#### 1. Stateful SSH Sessions and Interactive Prompts
- **Problem**: Nested SSH deployments were getting stuck when running sequential commands
- **Solution**: Implemented `StatefulSSHExecutor` class using SSH2's shell() method
- **Features**:
  - Maintains persistent SSH session state between commands
  - Supports nested SSH scenarios (jump servers)
  - Handles interactive prompts during deployment
  - Real-time prompt detection and user input handling
  - Script completion detection
  - 30-second timeout protection with activity tracking

#### 2. Interactive Deployment Support
- **GUI Implementation**:
  - Yellow-highlighted prompt UI with input field
  - Real-time prompt detection during deployment
  - Async communication via Server-Sent Events
  - Context preservation with session IDs
  
- **CLI Implementation**:
  - Readline interface for terminal prompts
  - Colored output with clear visual feedback
  - Synchronous flow for user input

#### 3. UI/UX Enhancements

##### JSON Mode for Sub-deployments
- Added full JSON editing support to EditSubDeployment component
- Multiple edit modes: full config, config only, local steps, remote steps
- Real-time validation with visual indicators
- File location display for reference

##### Inline Step Editing
- Added edit functionality for deployment steps without JSON mode
- Click pencil icon to enter edit mode
- Editable fields:
  - Step name
  - Command
  - Working directory
  - Continue on error flag
  - Interactive flag
- Save/cancel buttons for changes
- Implemented in EditSubDeployment (EditProject has the functions ready but UI not implemented)

##### Monorepo Settings Management
- Added "Edit Settings" button in SubDeployments view
- Links to EditProject component for full monorepo configuration
- All monorepo settings now editable through the UI

##### Display Name Consistency
- Fixed all views to show user-friendly display names instead of slugs
- Updated components:
  - Dashboard project list
  - EditProject header
  - EditSubDeployment header
  - SubDeployments header
  - AddSubDeployment header
- Automatic fallback to slug if display name not set

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Key Files Added/Modified

**New Files**:
- `src/pipeline/executor-stateful-ssh.js` - Core stateful SSH implementation
- `docs/STATEFUL_SSH.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- Multiple intermediate executor implementations (for testing)

**Modified Files**:
- `src/api/server.js` - Added stateful SSH support and prompt handling
- `src/cli/interface.js` - Added CLI interactive prompt support
- `gui/src/components/DeploymentView.jsx` - Added prompt UI
- `gui/src/components/EditSubDeployment.jsx` - Added JSON mode and inline editing
- `gui/src/components/EditProject.jsx` - Prepared for inline editing
- `gui/src/components/SubDeployments.jsx` - Added edit settings button
- Various other components for display name consistency

#### API Changes
- New endpoint: `POST /api/deployments/:name/input` for sending user input
- Enhanced SSE events for prompt detection and real-time output

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined" error in deployment results
- Fixed duplicate `updateStep` function declaration in EditProject
- Improved error handling for script completion
- Better contrast for prompt display

### Documentation Updates
- Updated CLAUDE.md with all new features
- Enhanced GUI_DOCUMENTATION.md with editing features
- Added GUI section to MONOREPO_GUIDE.md
- Created comprehensive STATEFUL_SSH.md guide
- Updated CLI_REFERENCE.md with interactive features

### Testing Checklist Additions
- Stateful SSH maintains session between commands
- Interactive prompts work in both GUI and CLI
- Nested SSH commands execute properly
- Script completion detection works correctly
- User input is properly sent to deployment scripts
- Prompt UI shows with correct styling
- Inline step editing works in form views
- Monorepo settings can be edited through EditProject
- JSON mode works for sub-deployments
- Display names show correctly in all views

### Commits Made
1. Add stateful SSH sessions and interactive prompt support
2. Add JSON mode to monorepo sub-deployments and improve UI
3. Add inline step editing and improve monorepo UI
4. Update documentation for new UI features
5. Fix duplicate updateStep function declaration in EditProject

### Future Considerations
- Complete inline step editing UI implementation in EditProject
- Add environment variable and input management UI for steps
- Consider adding step templates for common deployment patterns
- Implement deployment progress percentage based on step completion
- Add support for parallel step execution

### Known Limitations
- EditProject has inline editing functions but UI not yet implemented
- Step environment variables and inputs need UI for editing
- No validation for step commands before execution
- Interactive prompts require manual input (no auto-fill yet)
