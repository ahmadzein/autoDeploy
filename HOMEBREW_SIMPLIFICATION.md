# Homebrew Installation Simplification

## Current Installation Methods

Due to how Homebrew works, these are the only possible installation methods:

### Method 1: Tap + Install (Recommended)
```bash
brew tap ahmadzein/autodeploy
brew install autodeploy
brew install autodeploy --with-gui
```

### Method 2: Direct Install
```bash
brew install ahmadzein/autodeploy/autodeploy
brew install ahmadzein/autodeploy/autodeploy --with-gui
```

## Why `brew install ahmadzein/autodeploy` doesn't work

Homebrew interprets commands as:
- `brew install <formula>` - Install from core
- `brew install <user>/<tap>/<formula>` - Install from tap
- `brew install <user>/<formula>` - This looks for tap "user" not "user/tap"

## The Simplest Solution

Update your documentation to recommend the tap method:

```bash
# One-time setup
brew tap ahmadzein/autodeploy

# Then users can simply use:
brew install autodeploy
brew upgrade autodeploy
```

## Alternative: Shell Alias

Users who want a super simple command can add this to their shell:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias autodeploy-install="brew tap ahmadzein/autodeploy && brew install autodeploy"
```

Then they can just run:
```bash
autodeploy-install
```

## Future: Homebrew Core

When your project is accepted into homebrew-core, users will be able to:
```bash
brew install autodeploy
```

No tap needed at all!
